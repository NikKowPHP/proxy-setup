    Thank you for running the scripts and providing the output. I have analyzed it carefully and found the exact cause of the failure.

    **Analysis:**
    The logs show a clear sequence of events leading to the network outage:
    1.  **Typo in `start_proxy.sh`**: The script output shows the error `Cannot find device "up"`. This is caused by a typo I introduced in the previous version of the script. The line `ip link set dev $Virtual_tun_device up` uses a variable with a capital 'V', but the variable was defined as `VIRTUAL_TUN_DEVICE` (all caps). Shell variables are case-sensitive, so the command failed.
    2.  **`tun0` Device Not Activated**: Because of this typo, the `tun0` virtual network device was never brought "up" (activated).
    3.  **Routing Failure**: The script then proceeded to delete the original default route. However, when it tried to add the new default route pointing to the `tun0` device, this command failed because the device was not active.
    4.  **No Default Route**: The end result, as shown in the diagnostic output under `[2]`, is that your system has **no default route at all**. This is why all external network connections are failing.

    **Plan of Action:**
    This is a straightforward fix. I will correct the typo in `start_proxy.sh`.

    1.  **Fix `start_proxy.sh`**: I will change `$Virtual_tun_device` back to the correct variable, `$VIRTUAL_TUN_DEVICE`.
    2.  **Update `TASKS.md`**: I will add a final task to document this fix. This should resolve the issue completely.
