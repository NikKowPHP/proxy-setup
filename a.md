    The DNS resolution in `start_proxy.sh` is still failing despite previous fixes. This indicates a deeper, underlying issue with the network configuration that simple retries cannot solve. Instead of guessing further, I will create a comprehensive diagnostic script as requested.

This script, `diagnose_network.sh`, will be a non-destructive tool that gathers critical information about the system's state:
1.  **General Connectivity:** Checks `ip addr`, `ip route`, and basic `ping` to an external IP.
2.  **DNS Resolver Status:** Inspects `systemd-resolved` status, `/etc/resolv.conf`, and `resolvectl`.
3.  **DNS Resolution Tests:** Attempts to resolve hostnames using both the system's default resolver and a direct query to a public DNS server (`1.1.1.1`) to isolate the point of failure.
4.  **Firewall Rules:** Dumps `iptables` rules, especially from the `mangle` table used by the proxy scripts.
5.  **Proxy Reachability:** Directly tests the connection to the proxy server using `curl`.

Creating this script will provide the necessary data to accurately identify and fix the root cause. I will also make the script executable.
